# UTM_Project_CNN
.._Proto_Prepare_Test_Train_Data  Uploads and Implements EDA to prepare data for modelling
 +  trains model to classify RGB pixel to serve as approach for thresholding

  2_Image_Classification  +  2_Image_Classification_CNN_Binary trains model to classify 
  object on image ( single object on image )

  3_Image_Detection 
    applies NN and opencv Count Contours as baseline model to count number of apples on picture
    pending: apply Selective search,  Non-Max Suppression to count number of apples
